# Spectral-Methods

(1) This project is the result of the lecture seriers 

    "Spectral Methods for Differential Equations and Applications in Mechanics"

    Curriculum: https://www.mib.uni-stuttgart.de/en/chair1/teaching/spectral-methods/
    Lecturer: Lu Trong Khiem Nguyen
    Exercise: Lu Trong Khiem Nguyen
    Lecture Notes: Lu Trong Khiem Nguyen

(2) The MATLAB code and the lecture notes for this lecture series is based on th highly cited textbook 
    "Spectral Methods in Matlab" by Prof. Lloyd N. Trefethen. However, the code is modified so that it 
    fits better into the classroom. The exercise sets are also provided separately; they cannot be found
    in the textbook.
    
(3) The lecture notes were prepared in hand-written format. Each chapter is accomplied with the MATLAB 
    code and the lecture notes in one folder. The exercises are separated in other folders. As for users
    who are familiar with Python and Numpy, the set of python codes corresponding to the provided MATLAB 
    counterparts is also provided.
    
(4) Please refer to the textbook "Spectral Methods in Matlab". All of the intellectual contents of this 
    lecture series are accredited to Prof. Lloyd N. Trefethen and his ready-to-use MATLAB codes. Thanks
    to his well-written textbook, these lectures are possible.
